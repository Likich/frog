This repository contains a comprehensive language classification solution using an ensemble model that classifies languages based on macro-families and then further refines the classification to identify specific languages within each family. The classification model is trained on a diverse dataset comprising data from Wikipedia, Flores, and Tatoeba, making it a robust and accurate language identification system.
